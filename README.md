# Python-Programs

Welcome to this section of my Git Repository
> Started this on 3rd March, 2022
> Mainly uploading codes that helped me in building logical thinking and reasoning
> and also strengthened my Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## What to Expect?
1. Try to understand the logic I have put behind the codes
2. I try to implement simple logic, I leave the complexity part of it to space and time(pun intended)
3. If any of you comes up with a better solution to the problem; please do let me know
4. The difficulty level of the programs will keep on increasing as the time passes by
5. Some of you maybe students(school or college), I hope this helps in building your aptitude!
